# SliceGame
SliceGame is game based on Fruit Ninja, build with Python and PyGame
It can be played with a touchscreen, but also using a mouse. To play it on an Android device you can use PyDroid

**Note** 
This game isnÂ´t very optimized and PyGame is not the worlds fastest game engine, so I suggest playing it fullscreen on slower devices.  
I experienced less stuttering playing it fullscreen.
